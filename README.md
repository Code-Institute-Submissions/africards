## 1. User Experience - UX


### 1.1. User Stories

**User Story 1:**

**User Story 2:**

**User Story 3:**

**User Story 4:**

**User Story 5:**

**User Story 6:**

**User Story 7:**

I have compiled my project development files in a folder which can be viewed [here]().

### 1.2. Structure and Skeleton Phases

I used [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) to construct my mockups. However, there were limited features on this software to illustrate what I intended to present (e.g. colours, animation etc). These extra features were noted down and I decided to progress with building the outline/template of the website by block commenting out section headings in my GitPod workspace.


## 2. Features

This section will detail the _Surface_ phase of the project.

[Africards](https://jerhabor.github.io/africards/index.html) has only one page.

### 2.1. Features

### 2.2. Features Left to Implement

## 3. Technologies Used

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Africards used Git as the version control system during its development.
- [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) - This is an online Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) - This is a desktop application built with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Node.js integration.
- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) - HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it is the backbone of Africards. The latest version - HTML5 - was used to add and structure the site content.
- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) - CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. The latest version - CSS3 - was used to style all HTML content of Africards as well as style based on JavaScript functionalities.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Africards uses Bootstrap's grid system to layout site content in a structured manner. The framework also provides some assistance to styling with `class` names.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This font library offers a wide variety of font styles to help with the Africard's brand. This project uses [Barriecito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barriecito).
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Africards uses this icon library with its great selection of icons, to improve user experience (UX).
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com) - 
- [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Africards uses the JQuery Framework in its script. It also assists Bootstrap functionalities e.g. the loading of modal forms. 
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - Used to construct my wireframes in the skeleton phase of UX.

**User Story 6:**

**User Story 7:**

#### User Feedback

### 4.3. Code Validation
**HMTL Code Validation**  

**CSS Code Validation**  

### 4.4. Test on Different Browsers

Key: &#x2714; = Functions well  

### 4.5. Test on Different Devices

Key: &#x2714; = Displays as intended

 ### 4.6. Bugs and Problems

#### 4.6.1. Border on icons button 
Still visible despite being set to none 

#### 4.6.2 Possible slow loading
CDN is used so if internet connection is slow, the page could also load slowly. Not intended to affect UX as script is placed at the end of the body element.


## 5. Deployment

Africards is deployed to GitHub Pages using its `master` branch; the only available branch at the moment.  
The deployed link is: [https://jerhabor.github.io/africards](https://jerhabor.github.io/africards/).

### To deploy:
- Go to Africards [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jerhabor/africards)
- Click on Settings (above the green _"Clone"_ button)
- Scroll down to **GitHub Pages**
- Under source, select the `master` branch
- The page will automatically refresh and the following will be seen:

### Developing/Editing code:

In the event of making changes to code externally (i.e. not in an IDE workspace such as GitPod), `commit` changes so that you can use `git pull` in the IDE.

When working in GitPod IDE, the process to push to the repository is as follows:
~~~
$ git status
$ git add (insert file name)
$ git commit -m "(classify change and mention why changes were made for this version)"
$ git push
~~~

To track all files/add to storage area all at once, use instead:
~~~
$ git add .
~~~

### Running file locally  

In the IDE terminal, type:
~~~ 
$ python3 -m http.server
~~~

The following pop-up box will appear:  
<img src="assets/images/run-local.JPG" alt="Message: A service is available on port 8000"/>  

Click *"Make Public"* so that it is viewable on other devices with the browser link. The following box will now appear:  
<img src="assets/images/run-local2.JPG" alt="Message: A service is available on port 8000"/>

Click *"Open Browser"* and a new tab will run the code from the IDE locally.

**Key Notes:**
* You must save changes in your documents in order to see the reflected product when running locally.  
* Try clearing the browser cache if changes to code do not seem to be running when saved.

### Clone Repository
- Go to Africards [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jerhabor/africards)
- Click on the green _"Clone"_ button and a dropdown will appear. You will see:

You can choose to:
- Copy link to clipboard and paste in the browser address bar.  
- Alternatively, click _"Open in Desktop"_ to use GitHub desktop.
